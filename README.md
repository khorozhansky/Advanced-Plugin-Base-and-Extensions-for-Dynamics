# Advanced Plugin Base and Extensions for Dynamics 365 / Dynamics CRM 

The solution makes plugins development more aligned, assists in covering non-straightforward scenarios, avoid some routine coding, simplifies advanced context operations as well as provides a set of useful extensions. This tool significantly expands the limitations of out-of-box plugin log / tracing mechanism providing much more detailed info about the current, parent and grand-parent contexts along with serialized data from target, images, shared variables and so forth. 

The description and Wiki will be provided soon.
